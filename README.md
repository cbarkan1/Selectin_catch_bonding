# Selectin_catch_bonding

This repository contains python code to reproduce the figures in "Topology of molecular deformations induces triphasic catch bonding in selectin-ligand bonds" by Casey O. Barkan and Robijn F. Bruinsma.

The python files for figures are:
fig1C.py
fig1DEFG.py
fig2ACE_3AC.py
fig2BDF_3B.py
fig3D.py

if statements within these scripts allow one to select which figure to create.
